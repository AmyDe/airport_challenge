## My approach

# Please see my Diode for further info.

I approached this in the manner taught through the previous Boris Bikes challenge.

I used TDD to feature test my code, find what wasn't available that I needed (based on the user story requirements) and then wrote an RSpec test (which then failed) and then wrote code to pass that test at the simplest level. I continued to do that for each feature, refactoring as I went along. Once the basics were done, I then created more interactive code, whilst still using the TDD method.
